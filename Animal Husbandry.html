(1a)<br><br>
(PICK ANY FOUR)<br><br>
(i) Cattle are ruminants with a complex four-chambered stomach (rumen, reticulum, omasum, abomasum), while poultry have a single-chambered stomach.
<br><br>(ii) Cattle chew their cud and have the ability to ferment fibrous plant materials in the rumen, while poultry lack this capability.
<br><br>(iii) Cattle have a longer digestive tract compared to poultry, allowing for more efficient digestion of roughage and cellulose.
<br><br>(iv) Poultry have a crop and a gizzard, which help grind and store food, while cattle do not have these structures.
<br><br>(v) Cattle rely more on microbial fermentation in the rumen for nutrient absorption, while poultry have a shorter and more simple digestive system.
<br><br>(vi) The digestive enzymes and pH levels differ between the two species, with cattle being better adapted to digest fibrous plant materials.
<br><br>
(1b) <br><br>
(PICK ANY FOUR)<br><br>
<br><br>(i)  Regularly administering effective anthelmintic (dewormers) to eliminate worms.
<br><br>(ii) Rotating grazing areas, avoiding overstocking, and properly managing manure to break the worm lifecycle.
<br><br>(iii) Maintaining clean housing, feeders, and waterers to reduce worm transmission.
<br><br>(iv) Providing a balanced diet and appropriate nutritional supplements to support the animal's immune response.
<br><br>(v) Introducing natural predators of worms, such as certain nematophagous fungi, to reduce worm populations.
<br><br>(vi) Selecting animals with genetic resistance or tolerance to worm infections to gradually improve the herd's or flock's resilience.
<br><br>
(1c) <br><br>
(PICK ANY THREE)<br><br>
<br><br>(i) Crossbreeding: Introducing genetic material from high-performing exotic breeds to improve the productivity and adaptability of local breeds.
<br><br>(ii) Selective breeding: Identifying and selectively breeding the most desirable traits within the local breed population to enhance desirable characteristics.
<br><br>(iii) Genomic selection: Utilizing genetic markers and genomic information to guide selective breeding programs and accelerate genetic progress.
<br><br>(iv)Improving management practices: Optimizing feeding, housing, healthcare, and other management factors to support the expression of the local breed's genetic potential.
<br><br>
(1d) <br><br>
(i) CREEP FEEDING
<br><br>(PICK ANY THREE)
<br><br>(i) Increased growth rate and weight gain in young animals
<br><br>(ii) Improved feed conversion efficiency
<br><br>(iii) Enhanced immune function and disease resistance
<br><br>(iv) Earlier weaning and transition to solid feed
<br><br>
(ii) DEHORNING<br><br>
(PICK ANY THREE)<br><br>
(i) Reduces the risk of injuries to animals and handlers
<br><br>(ii) Prevents damage to housing, equipment, and other animals
<br><br>(iii) Facilitates easier handling and management of the animals
<br><br>(iv) Helps maintain a more uniform herd or flock appearance
<br><br>
(2a)
<br><br>(i) Improved animal health and welfare.
<br><br>(ii) Better control of environmental factors like temperature and humidity.
<br><br>(iii) Reduced risk of disease transmission.
<br><br>(iv) Increased productivity and growth rates.
<br><br>(v) Enhanced reproductive performance.
<br><br>(vi) Minimized stress levels leading to higher quality products.
<br><br>
(2b)<br><br>

<br><br>(i) Preventing aggression and injury among different age groups.
<br><br>(ii) Avoiding competition for resources such as food and water.
<br><br>(iii) Minimizing the spread of diseases between age groups.
<br><br>(iv) Tailoring feeding and management practices to specific age-related needs.
<br><br>
(2c)<br><br>
(i) Cleaning and disinfecting the entire facility.
<br><br>(ii) Checking and calibrating heating equipment to maintain appropriate temperature levels.
<br><br>(iii) Providing clean bedding material.
<br><br>(iv) Ensuring adequate ventilation.
<br><br>(v) Setting up feeders and drinkers with fresh water and appropriate chick feed.
<br><br><br><br>
(2d)<br><br>
<br><br>(i) Pelt: Sheep
<br><br>(ii) Bristle: Pig
<br><br>(iii) Mohair: Angora goat
<br><br>(iv) Veal: Calf (young cattle)
<br><br>(v) Lard: Pig
