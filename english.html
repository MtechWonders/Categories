		The town of Addyvile was known for its tranquil nights, where the soft whisper of the wind through the trees was the only sound that disrupted the silence. For years, I had lived there, relishing in the peacefulness that enveloped the small community. Little did I know that one fateful night would shatter that illusion forever.
		
		It was a chilly evening in late autumn when it happened. I had just finished dinner and settled into my favorite armchair with a book, ready to lose myself in its pages. The familiar routine was comforting, and I felt content as I immersed myself in the story.
		
		As the night wore on, a sudden knock at the door jolted me from my reverie. I frowned, puzzled by the interruption. Who could be calling at this hour? With cautious steps, I made my way to the door and peered through the peephole, expecting to see a familiar face.
		
		To my surprise, there stood a stranger, his silhouette illuminated by the dim glow of the porch light. Instinctively, I hesitated, unsure whether to open the door or pretend I wasn't home. But something about the urgency in his demeanor compelled me to unlock the door and face him.
		
		The stranger introduced himself as John, a traveler passing through town in need of assistance. He claimed to have lost his way and was seeking shelter for the night. Despite my initial apprehension, I couldn't turn him away, not on a cold night like this.
		
		Reluctantly, I invited John inside, offering him a warm meal and a place to rest. As we sat across from each other at the kitchen table, he shared snippets of his journey, painting a picture of adventure and uncertainty. There was an air of mystery about him, and I found myself captivated by his tales.
		
		Hours passed, and fatigue began to weigh heavily on my eyelids. I suggested that John retire to the guest room for the night, assuring him that he was welcome to stay until morning. With a grateful nod, he bid me goodnight and disappeared down the hallway.
		
		Alone once again, I settled into bed, the events of the evening swirling in my mind. Despite my reservations, there was a sense of satisfaction in helping a stranger in need. As I drifted off to sleep, I was filled with a newfound sense of purpose, grateful for the unexpected twist fate had thrown my way.
		
		But as the hours passed and darkness enveloped the town, a sense of unease began to creep into my subconscious. The stillness of the night was shattered by a series of strange noises echoing through the house. My heart raced as I realized the truth: I was mistaken to have thought the night would be like other peaceful nights.
